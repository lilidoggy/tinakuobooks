        <title>丁小飛校園日記4：聰明眼鏡</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first book that I managed to contribute to one of Tina’s books. It so happend that I was really drolling over what people were saying about Google Glass at the time. So when Tina asked me about a cool tech toy for Fei, it had to be some kind of Glass gizmo!&lt;/p&gt;
